# 🚀 WIDGET TEST - QUICK GUIDE

## ⚠️ Xcode Preview Not Working?
**That's normal!** Use home screen test instead (more reliable anyway).

---

## ✅ DO THIS:

### 1. Run Main App (5 seconds)
```
Xcode scheme: "AdMetrics" ← NOT widget!
Press: ⌘ + R
Wait: Until data loads
```

### 2. Check Console (Look for this):
```
✅ Widget data saved successfully
```
**See this?** → Data is ready! Continue to step 3.  
**Don't see this?** → Tell me, I'll add logging.

### 3. Add Widget to Home (30 seconds)
```
1. ⌘ + Shift + H (home screen)
2. Long press empty space
3. Tap "+"
4. Find "AdMetrics"
5. Add "Medium" widget
6. Done!
```

### 4. Check Widget (What do you see?)
```
OPTION A: Your real balance ($43.61, your revenue, your chart)
→ ✅ SUCCESS! Everything works!

OPTION B: Placeholder ($1234.56, fake stats)
→ ⚠️ SharedDataManager not working, tell me

OPTION C: "No data available" or error
→ ⚠️ CacheService issue, tell me

OPTION D: Can't find "AdMetrics" in gallery
→ ⚠️ Widget not built, do this:
   - Select "AdMetricsWidgetExtension" scheme
   - Press ⌘ + B (build)
   - Try step 3 again
```

---

## 🎯 WHAT TO REPORT:

Just tell me: **A, B, C, or D** from step 4 above!

---

## 💡 WHY XCODE PREVIEW FAILED:

The "red icon and inferior name" means:
- Widget extension needs a host app to attach to
- Xcode preview method doesn't always work
- Home screen test is more reliable anyway

**Don't worry about it - home screen test is better!**

---

## 🔧 IF "ADMETRICS" NOT IN WIDGET GALLERY:

```bash
# In Xcode:
1. Select "AdMetricsWidgetExtension" scheme
2. Product → Build (⌘ + B)
3. Check for build errors
4. Try adding widget again
```

---

**Just do steps 1-4 and tell me which option (A/B/C/D) you get!** 🚀
