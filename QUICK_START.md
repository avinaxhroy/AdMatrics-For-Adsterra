## 🎯 How to Use Now

### Step 1: Run the Main App
```bash
# In Xcode:
⌘ + R (or click Run button)

# App will:
- Launch on your Mac
- Create shared data directory
- Wait for you to load data
```

### Step 2: Load Your Data
```bash
1. Enter API key in app
2. Tap "Load Data"
3. Wait for success message
4. Check console: "✅ Widget data saved successfully"
```

### Step 3: Add Widget

2. "Edit Widgets"
3. Search "AdMetrics"
4. Drag widget to Desktop or Notification Center
```

## 📂 Where Data is Stored

```
~/Library/Application Support/AdMetrics-Shared/
├── widget-data.json          # Your stats
├── refresh-interval.txt      # Update frequency
└── widget-theme.txt          # Theme preference
```

Both your app and widgets can access this location!

## 🐛 If Widgets Don't Show

### Option 1: Refresh Widget System
```bash
killall Dock
```

### Option 2: Re-register App
```bash
# In Xcode, clean and rebuild:
⌘ + Shift + K  (Clean)
⌘ + R          (Run)
```

### Option 3: Check Data File
```bash
# Run test script:
./test_widget_free.sh

# Or manually check:
ls -la ~/Library/Application\ Support/AdMetrics-Shared/
cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/AdMetrics-Shared/widget-data.json
```
