# ✅ Widget Testing Checklist

## 🎯 Current Status
- ✅ Main app working perfectly
- ⏳ Widget needs testing

## 📋 Do This Next (In Order):

### 1. Check Console for Data Save Message
When main app is running, look for this in Xcode console:
```
✅ Widget data saved successfully
```

**If you see this:** Data is being shared correctly! ✅  
**If you don't see this:** Main app might not be saving to SharedDataManager

---

### 2. Test Widget on Home Screen

**Steps:**
1. With main app still open (or data already loaded)
2. Press `⌘ + Shift + H` to go home
3. Long press empty space on home screen
4. Tap `+` button (top left corner)
5. Scroll down and find **"AdMetrics"**
6. Choose a widget size (try Medium first - shows chart)
7. Tap "Add Widget"

**Expected Result:**
- Widget shows your balance (~$43.61)
- Widget shows today's revenue
- Widget shows 7-day chart (if Medium/Large)
- Widget shows real stats

**If it shows placeholder ($1234.56):**
- SharedDataManager might not be working
- Let me know and I'll debug

---

### 3. Alternative: Test in Xcode Widget Preview

**Steps:**
1. In Xcode toolbar, click scheme dropdown
2. Select **"AdMetricsWidgetExtension"**
3. Press `⌘ + R`
4. Dialog appears: "Choose an app to run"
5. Select **"Xcode"** from the list
6. Click **"Run"**

**Expected Result:**
- Widget preview window opens
- Shows Small, Medium, Large widgets
- All show your real data

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Widget Shows Placeholder Data ($1234.56)

**This means:** SharedDataManager isn't sharing data between app and widget

**Possible causes:**
1. SharedDataManager.swift not added to widget target
2. Main app hasn't saved data yet
3. App Groups still enabled (should be removed)

**Let me know if you see placeholder data and I'll fix it!**

---

### Widget Not Found in Gallery

**This means:** Widget extension not built

**Fix:**
1. Clean build: `⌘ + Shift + K`
2. Select "AdMetricsWidgetExtension" scheme
3. Build: `⌘ + B`
4. Try adding widget again

---

### "No data available" Message

**This means:** CacheService can't load data

**Fix:**
1. Run main app
2. Let it load data from API
3. Check console for "Widget data saved"
4. Try widget again

---

## 📊 Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Run the test guide
./test_widget.sh

# Check if SharedDataManager exists
find . -name "SharedDataManager.swift"

# Check for errors
# (Do this in Xcode: Product > Build for > Any iOS Device)
```
