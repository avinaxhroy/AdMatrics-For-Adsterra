# Changes Made to Fix API 404 Error

## Summary
I've added detailed logging to help debug the "Endpoint not found" error and created tools to find the correct API endpoint.

## Files Modified

### 1. **AdsterraAPIService.swift** - Enhanced Error Logging
- Added detailed console logging for all API requests and responses
- Logs show:
  - Exact URL being called
  - Request headers
  - Response status code
  - Response body (for debugging)
  - Detailed 404 error information

**What to do:** Run the app in Xcode and check the Debug Console to see exactly what URL is failing.

### 2. **AdsterraStats.swift** - Better Error Messages
- Updated error messages to be more helpful
- Added suggestion to check Adsterra API documentation
- Provides link to docs in recovery suggestion

### 3. **test_api.sh** - API Endpoint Testing Script (NEW)
**This is your best tool to find the correct endpoint!**

Usage:
```bash
cd /Users/avinash/Documents/AdMetrics
./test_api.sh YOUR_API_KEY
```

This script will:
- Test multiple possible Adsterra API endpoint URLs
- Show which ones work (200 OK)
- Show which ones fail (404, 401, etc.)
- Tell you exactly which base URL to use in the code

### 4. **API_TROUBLESHOOTING.md** - Complete Guide (NEW)
Comprehensive troubleshooting guide with:
- Step-by-step solutions
- Alternative endpoint URLs to try
- How to test with curl
- How to read the debug logs
- Where to find Adsterra API documentation

## Next Steps

### Option A: Use the Test Script (Recommended ‚≠ê)
```bash
cd /Users/avinash/Documents/AdMetrics
./test_api.sh YOUR_API_KEY
```

The script will test all common Adsterra API endpoints and tell you which one works!

### Option B: Check Debug Logs in Xcode
1. Open the project in Xcode
2. Run the app (‚åò + R)
3. Open Debug Console (‚åò + Shift + Y)
4. Enter your API key in the app
5. Look for the log output showing:
   ```
   üåê API Request:
      URL: https://api3.adsterratools.com/publisher/profile.json
   
   üì• API Response:
      Status: 404
      Body: ...
   ```

### Option C: Manual curl Test
```bash
# Test the current endpoint
curl -v -X GET "https://api3.adsterratools.com/publisher/profile.json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: application/json"

# If you get 404, try alternatives:
curl -v -X GET "https://publishers.adsterra.com/api/v2/publisher/profile" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: application/json"
```

### Option D: Check Adsterra Documentation
1. Log into: https://beta.publishers.adsterra.com
2. Go to API section
3. Look for:
   - "API Base URL"
   - "API Documentation"
   - Example API requests
4. Compare with line 14 in `AdMetrics/Services/AdsterraAPIService.swift`

## Most Likely Fix

Once you find the correct API base URL (from the test script or documentation):

**Edit:** `AdMetrics/Services/AdsterraAPIService.swift`

**Line 14:** Change from:
```swift
private let baseURL = "https://api3.adsterratools.com/publisher"
```

To: (whatever the correct URL is, for example):
```swift
private let baseURL = "https://publishers.adsterra.com/api/v2/publisher"
```

Then rebuild and run the app!

## Why This Happened

The 404 error means one of these:
1. **API URL changed**: Adsterra may have updated their API endpoints
2. **Wrong API version**: Your account might use a different API version (v2, v3, etc.)
3. **Region-specific URL**: Some APIs have different URLs for different regions
4. **Account type difference**: Publisher vs Advertiser APIs might have different URLs

## Need More Help?

Run the test script first - it's the fastest way to find the answer:
```bash
./test_api.sh YOUR_API_KEY
```

If the script finds a working endpoint, it will tell you exactly what to change in the code!
