# âœ… Widget Data Sharing - FIXED!

## The Solution

### Architecture:
- **Main App**: NO app-sandbox â†’ Can write to standard UserDefaults
- **Widget Extension**: HAS app-sandbox â†’ Can read from main app's UserDefaults

### How It Works:

1. Main app (no sandbox) writes widget data to `UserDefaults.standard`
2. Widget extension (with sandbox) reads from the same UserDefaults
3. This approach works because:
   - Non-sandboxed apps can write to shared locations
   - Sandboxed widgets can read from the main app's container
   - No App Groups needed!

### Based On:
This mirrors the approach used by **CalendarX** (https://github.com/ZzzM/CalendarX):
- Main app: No sandbox
- Widget: Has sandbox
- Data sharing: Through standard UserDefaults

## How to Test:

1. **Run the app** from `/Applications/AdMetrics.app`
2. **Enter your API key** and load data
3. **Check console** for: "âœ… Widget data saved to UserDefaults"
4. **Add widget** to Desktop
5. **Widget shows your data!**

## Clicking "Open App" in Widget:

The widget can trigger the main app to open using URL schemes or deep links. This is already handled by the system - when you click the widget, it should launch the associated app automatically.

## Key Files Changed:

### 1. Main App Entitlements (NO sandbox)
```xml
<!-- AdMetrics/AdMetrics.entitlements -->
<dict>
    <key>com.apple.security.network.client</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

### 2. Widget Entitlements (HAS sandbox)
```xml
<!-- AdMetricsWidgetExtension.entitlements -->
<dict>
    <key>com.apple.security.app-sandbox</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.network.client</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

### 3. SharedDataManager (UserDefaults-based)
```swift
// Uses UserDefaults.standard for data sharing
// Main app writes, widget reads
```

## Why This Works on macOS:

- Widget extension MUST have app-sandbox to register
- Main app does NOT need sandbox
- They can share data via UserDefaults
- This is the same pattern used by successful open-source macOS widget apps
