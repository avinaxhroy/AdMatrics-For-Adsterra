# âœ… Balance Issue Fixed

## What Was Wrong

Your app showed **$76.25** labeled as "Balance"  
But your actual Adsterra balance is **$43.15**

**Why?** The app was showing your **7-day revenue total**, not your actual account balance!

## The Root Cause

The Adsterra API v3 **does NOT provide a balance endpoint** in the official documentation.

The API only gives:
- Revenue per day (from stats)
- Impressions, clicks, CTR, CPM
- Placements and domains

Your actual balance ($43.15) includes:
- All-time earnings: $8,333.02
- Minus payments: -$8,517.48  
- Plus adjustments: +$1.26
- Plus referrals: +$226.35
- **= Balance: $43.15**

But the API only shows **recent revenue**, not the full balance calculation!

## What I Fixed

### Changed All Labels from "Balance" â†’ "7-Day Revenue"

**Files Updated:**
1. âœ… `ContentView.swift` - Main app dashboard
2. âœ… `SmallWidgetView.swift` - Small widget
3. âœ… `MediumWidgetView.swift` - Medium widget  
4. âœ… `LargeWidgetView.swift` - Large widget
5. âœ… `AdMetricsWidget.swift` - Widget descriptions

### Before (Misleading):
```
Balance: $76.25
```

### After (Accurate):
```
7-Day Revenue: $76.25  
or
7d Revenue: $76.25 (in widgets)
```

Now users understand this is the **revenue for the past 7 days**, not the total account balance!

## Test Your App

### Step 1: Rebuild
```bash
# Open Xcode
open /Users/avinash/Documents/AdMetrics/AdMetrics.xcodeproj

# Clean Build: âŒ˜ + Shift + K
# Build & Run: âŒ˜ + R
```

### Step 2: Verify Labels
You should now see:
- **Main App:** "7-Day Revenue: $76.25"
- **Widgets:** "7d Revenue: $76.25"

### Step 3 (Optional): Test Profile Endpoint
Run this to see if there's a hidden balance endpoint:
```bash
cd /Users/avinash/Documents/AdMetrics
./test_profile.sh YOUR_API_KEY
```

This will tell you if `/profile.json` exists and returns actual balance.

## If Profile Endpoint Exists

If the test shows the endpoint works and returns your actual balance ($43.15), let me know! I can then:
1. Update the response model to parse it correctly
2. Change labels back to "Balance"
3. Show accurate account balance

## Additional Improvements (Optional)

### Option 1: Add Dashboard Link
Add a button that opens Adsterra dashboard for full balance:

```swift
Link("View Full Balance", destination: URL(...)!)
```

### Option 2: Manual Balance Entry
Add a setting where you can manually enter your balance:

```
Settings â†’ Account Balance: $43.15
```

Then the app shows:
```
Account Balance: $43.15
7-Day Revenue: $76.25
```

### Option 3: Balance Endpoint (If It Exists)
If profile endpoint works, parse it properly to show accurate balance.

## Summary

âœ… **Fixed:** Labels now correctly say "7-Day Revenue" instead of "Balance"  
âœ… **Accurate:** Shows what the API actually provides  
âœ… **No confusion:** Users understand this is period revenue  
âœ… **Other metrics:** Still correct (impressions, clicks, CTR, CPM, today's revenue)

### Your App Now Shows:
- **7-Day Revenue:** $76.25 âœ… (Accurate - this is 7 days of earnings)
- **Today's Revenue:** $0.00 âœ… (Accurate)
- **Impressions:** 1.5K âœ… (Accurate)
- **Clicks:** 0 âœ… (Accurate)
- **CTR:** 0.00% âœ… (Accurate)
- **CPM:** $43.76 âœ… (Accurate)

For actual account balance, users check the Adsterra dashboard! ðŸ“Š

**Build and test it now!** The labels should be accurate. ðŸŽ‰

If you want to add actual balance fetching (if the endpoint exists), run the test script and share the results!
