# âœ… DOUBLE CONTAINER ISSUE FIXED

## What Was Fixed

You correctly identified the problem: **"there are two container one is i think automatically adopt glass morphism but one is gray awalys"**

### The Issue
- macOS automatically provides a glass morphism container via `.containerBackground(for: .widget) { Color.clear }`
- But the widget view files were adding a SECOND layer: `ZStack { Rectangle().fill(.ultraThinMaterial) }`
- This created a gray overlay that blocked the automatic glass effect

### The Solution
Removed ALL custom background code from:
- âœ… `SmallWidgetView.swift` - Removed ZStack + Rectangle wrapper
- âœ… `MediumWidgetView.swift` - Removed ZStack + Rectangle wrapper  
- âœ… `LargeWidgetView.swift` - Removed ZStack + Rectangle wrapper

Now the content sits directly in the automatic glass container provided by macOS.

## Build Status
- âœ… Build succeeded (17:47)
- âœ… Installed to /Applications/AdMetrics.app
- âœ… No "please adopt containerBackground API" errors (already using `.containerBackground(for: .widget)`)

## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: You MUST Remove Old Widgets

**The old widgets on your desktop are CACHED SCREENSHOTS.**

macOS does NOT automatically update widgets. You must:

1. **Right-click each old widget â†’ "Remove Widget"**
2. **Go to Notification Center (top-right clock icon)**
3. **Scroll to bottom â†’ "Edit Widgets"**
4. **Find "AdMetrics" and add fresh widgets**

Until you do this, you will keep seeing the old gray double-container widgets.

## What To Expect

The new widgets will:
- Show your wallpaper blurred through (like Calendar/Weather widgets)
- Have NO gray overlay blocking the glass effect
- Use adaptive text colors (white on dark wallpaper, black on light wallpaper)
- Open the app when tapped

This matches how system widgets work on macOS.
