# üîç Balance Inconsistency - Analysis & Solution

## The Problem

**Adsterra Dashboard shows:** Balance = $43.15  
**Your App shows:** Balance = $76.25  
**Difference:** $33.10

## Why This Happens

### Adsterra Dashboard Balance Formula:
```
Balance = Earned - Paid + Adjustments + Referrals
Balance = $8,333.02 - $8,517.48 + $1.26 + $226.35 = $43.15
```

### What the API Provides:
The Adsterra API v3 **does NOT have a balance endpoint** in the public documentation!

Available endpoints:
- ‚úÖ `/stats.json` - Provides revenue, impressions, clicks, CTR, CPM
- ‚úÖ `/placements.json` - Provides placements list
- ‚úÖ `/domains.json` - Provides domains list
- ‚ùå `/profile.json` - **NOT in official docs** (may or may not exist)

### What Your App is Doing:
The app tries to fetch `/profile.json` which might not exist or might return different data. If it fails, the app calculates:

```
Balance = Sum of last 7 days revenue
Balance = $76.25  ‚Üê This is just revenue, not actual balance!
```

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Test if Profile Endpoint Exists

Run this script to check:
```bash
cd /Users/avinash/Documents/AdMetrics
./test_profile.sh YOUR_API_KEY
```

This will tell you:
- ‚úÖ If `/profile.json` endpoint exists
- ‚úÖ If it returns balance field
- ‚úÖ If the balance matches your dashboard ($43.15)

### Step 2A: If Profile Endpoint Works

If the test shows the endpoint returns correct balance, we need to fix the response parsing:

**Check the response structure** and update `AdsterraStats.swift` to match.

### Step 2B: If Profile Endpoint Doesn't Exist (Most Likely)

Since the official API docs don't mention a profile/balance endpoint, we have 3 options:

#### **Option 1: Change Label to "Period Revenue"** (Easiest)
Instead of showing "Balance", show "Period Revenue (7 days)" or "Total Earned (7d)"

This is accurate because the app IS showing the correct 7-day revenue total.

#### **Option 2: Manual Balance Input** (Most Accurate)
Add a setting where users can manually enter their balance from the dashboard.

#### **Option 3: Use Publisher ID Endpoint** (If Available)
Some APIs have a publisher/me or publisher/account endpoint that returns balance.

## Recommended Fix: Option 1 + Enhanced Display

Change the UI to be more accurate:

### Current (Misleading):
```
Balance: $76.25
Today's Revenue: $0.00
```

### Proposed (Accurate):
```
7-Day Revenue: $76.25
Today: $0.00
Balance: Check dashboard ‚Üó
```

Or:
```
Earned (7d): $76.25
Today: $0.00
üí° For account balance, see dashboard
```

## Implementation

I'll create two versions for you:

1. **Quick Fix:** Just change the labels
2. **Full Fix:** Add manual balance setting

Which would you prefer?

## Testing Your Current Setup

Please run:
```bash
cd /Users/avinash/Documents/AdMetrics
./test_profile.sh YOUR_API_KEY
```

And share the output. This will tell us:
1. Does profile endpoint exist?
2. Does it return balance?
3. What's the actual response structure?

Then we can implement the perfect fix!

## Temporary Workaround

Until we fix this properly, you can:
1. Know that the number shown is your **7-day revenue**, not account balance
2. Check the Adsterra dashboard for your actual balance
3. The other metrics (impressions, clicks, CTR, CPM, today's revenue) are correct!
