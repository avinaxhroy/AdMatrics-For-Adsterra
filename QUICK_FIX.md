# 🎯 Quick Action: Fix Balance Inconsistency

## What I Did

Changed "Balance" labels to "7-Day Revenue" throughout the app because:

- ❌ **Before:** App showed $76.25 as "Balance" (misleading)
- ✅ **After:** App shows $76.25 as "7-Day Revenue" (accurate!)

Your **actual Adsterra balance is $43.15** (check dashboard), but the API only provides revenue data, not the full balance calculation.

## Build & Test Now

```bash
# 1. Open project
open /Users/avinash/Documents/AdMetrics/AdMetrics.xcodeproj

# 2. In Xcode:
#    Clean: ⌘ + Shift + K
#    Run: ⌘ + R

# 3. Check the labels - should say "7-Day Revenue" or "7d Revenue"
```

## (Optional) Test if Balance Endpoint Exists

```bash
cd /Users/avinash/Documents/AdMetrics
./test_profile.sh YOUR_API_KEY
```

If this shows that `/profile.json` returns your actual balance ($43.15), let me know and I can update the app to use it!

## Files Changed

1. ✅ ContentView.swift - Main dashboard
2. ✅ SmallWidgetView.swift - Small widget  
3. ✅ MediumWidgetView.swift - Medium widget
4. ✅ LargeWidgetView.swift - Large widget
5. ✅ AdMetricsWidget.swift - Widget metadata

## Result

Your app now accurately displays:
- **7-Day Revenue:** $76.25 (sum of last 7 days earnings) ✅
- **Today's Revenue:** $0.00 ✅
- **All other metrics:** Accurate ✅

For your actual account balance ($43.15), users check the Adsterra dashboard.
