# Glass Morphism Design Complete âœ…

## What Was Changed

All three widgets have been redesigned with a premium glass morphism design:

### Design Changes:
- **Background**: Dark semi-transparent glass effect
  - Colors: RGB(0.1-0.15, 0.1-0.15, 0.15-0.2) with 0.75-0.85 opacity
  - Removed the bright sky blue gradient
  
- **Borders**: Subtle gradient stroke
  - From white.opacity(0.2) to white.opacity(0.05)
  - 1pt line width
  - Removed the odd white border
  
- **Shadows**: Professional depth
  - Black shadow with 0.3 opacity
  - 20pt radius blur
  - 10pt y-offset for floating effect
  
- **Text**: All white with varying opacity
  - Labels: white.opacity(0.5-0.7)
  - Values: white (full opacity)
  - Clean, readable on dark background
  
- **Cards**: Minimal glass effect
  - Background: white.opacity(0.05)
  - Border: white.opacity(0.1)
  - Icon colors for visual distinction
