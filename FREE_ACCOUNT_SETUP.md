## 🔍 How It Works

### Old Approach (Required Paid Account):
```
Main App → App Group Container → Widget
          ❌ Needs paid account
```

### New Approach (Works with Free Account):
```
Main App → SharedDataManager → UserDefaults → Widget
          ✅ Works with free account!
```

### Technical Details:
- **SharedDataManager**: Uses standard UserDefaults
- **Data Sharing**: Both app and widget access same UserDefaults
- **Security**: API key stored in Keychain (more secure than App Groups!)
- **Performance**: Same speed as App Groups
- **Compatibility**: Works on all iOS versions

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No module named SharedDataManager"
**Solution:** 
1. Make sure `SharedDataManager.swift` is in the `Shared` folder
2. Check that it's added to both targets:
   - AdMetrics ✓
   - AdMetricsWidgetExtension ✓

### Issue: Widget shows placeholder data
**Solution:**
1. Run main app first (⌘ + R)
2. Let it load data from API
3. Go to home screen
4. Add widget - should show real data now

### Issue: "App Group" error still appears
**Solution:**
You didn't remove the capability from both targets. Double-check:
- AdMetrics target: No App Groups ✓
- AdMetricsWidgetExtension target: No App Groups ✓
